### Current State and Future Plans

Conglobo is currently in beta and has been tested by a small group of users. The platform's resource-sharing feature has been proven to be effective in repurposing old and underutilized devices, and the platform has successfully reduced e-waste and carbon emissions.

In the future, we plan to expand the platform's capabilities by adding more applications and offering VPN access to the cluster from outside computers. We also plan to utilize Firebase for online app storage and push out new available apps to clients.
